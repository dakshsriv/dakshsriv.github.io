Procrastination is something we all have been affected by. Lounging about for several days and cramming for that test during one night. It usually leads to dismal results. However, there is an easy way to take control of it, rather than have it take cotrol of you. 

Procreastination can be broken into two types: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 Procrastination is the procrastination we're all familiar with. Here is how it works inside our brains. We decide to get or work done, and we're just about to do it, when that thought appears in our minds that there is a lot of time left to to do the project, so we can postpone it for later. Unfortunately, this cycle repeats over and over until the deadline gets closer. As the deadline approaches, we convince ourselves that there is still just enough time left. However, this process only lasts so long, until there are two or three days left, and panic arises. This panic forces you to do the work quickly and poorly. As dark as this may sound, a technique can be used to fix this whiloe improving the way you approach projects. Break your project up in to subtasks, each with a deadline. Now, you're already in the panic zone when each section is completed, so Type 1 Procrastination is eliminated for that project. However, Type 2 Procrastination still can cause trouble.

Procrastination is commonly assoiatecd with assignments or work with deadlines, but some things have no deadlines. They are just things you want to complete in youir life. For these, you can procrastinate forever until you approach death, when you lament upon you being unable to achieve those goals. In truth, you wouldn't even try to achieve them. This is the power of Type 2 Procrastination. However, Type 2 Procrastination can also be removed just like Type 1. Set goals for the year; New Year's Resolutions. Do this for the months and weeks too. This organization creates deadlines, which help you complete things. You HAVE to know how to control Type 1 Procrastination before controlling Type 2.

Altogether, procrastination is dangerous when left unchecked, but with a little bit of work, it can be controlled and used to your own advantage.
