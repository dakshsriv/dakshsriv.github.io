Everybody loves to be in that zone where they are comfortable and laid back. Many feel like they want to stay there forever and never leave. However, it might be a shock to know that zone can ruin your life.

There are 5 main zones in how much you feel comfortable to perform a task: the lost zone, the comfort zone, the discomfort zone, the growth zone, and the danger zone. Let me explain each one in detail. The comfort zone is the zone people feel most comfortable in. People who don't have enough willpower often stay in that zone for extended periods of time, ruining themselves slowly and slowly. I'll elaborate on that soon. This zone is the shallow water at a beach; no sense of adventure, but no danger either. If you push yourself just outside that zone, you enter the discomfort zone. In this zone, you feel uncomfortable and generally unwilling to stay there.
