A beautiful season with colourful leaves,  
Lovely foliage on all the trees,  
Not too hot and not too cold,  
The autumn colours are very bold.  

Red, orange, yellow, and brown,  
There’s no reason to wear a frown,  
These fall colours are nice and bright,  
Everywhere you see it’s a beautiful sight.  

As the days begin to shorten,  
And the fast winds blow in autumn,  
It makes the leaves skitter across the ground,  
Which were raked and put in a mound.  

Autumn is when we begin to harvest,  
Delicious pies and Thanksgiving fest,  
Apples, pies, and turkey too,  
There is always a lot to do.  

It is a season just so merry,  
Although Halloween is a bit scary,  
The leaves on trees begin to go,  
And very soon it starts to snow!
