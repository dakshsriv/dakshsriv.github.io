We’re as stubborn as mules, quick to say we’re the best.  

The best follow the rules, the best never do rest.  

The best choose wise options, like health and adoption.  

Do we? No.  

Our priorities are money, and high convenience.  

It’s painless as honey. but demands intelligence.  

But look at animals: Chimpanzees divide with tortoises.  

We must know what to fight for as we fight for what’s right.  

Money? Wrong.  

The present–? Wrong.  

The future––? Right.  


The future can’t cede for anything.  


The present should cede for the future.  


Hardships now are rainbows for the future.  


That, really is, what matters, the most.  


It’s time we remember:  

“Destiny is the great gift from above, given to you, along with life.”  


It’s time we restart, all our brains,  


Reorganize–up ‘till it rains.  


In land so dry there are no bees.  


It’s time we amend priorities,  


It’s time we cease biting the dust,  


It’s time we reclaim our title of,  


Truly, the best  

in,  

this,   

world,  


Then, and only then,  

Will,  

We,  

Be,  
            
free.
