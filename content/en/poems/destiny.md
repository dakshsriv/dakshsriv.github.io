Destiny,


It’s a great responsibility given just to you,

without which you are replaceable.


It is a gift from above,

offered to you along with life.


It gives you a sense of purpose,  

Deep inside you.  


In the darkest of times,  

It lights up your path and glows on what you aspire to master.  


It makes your life matter,  

and unifies you.  


You can become famous,  

if you set and follow your destiny.  


Using destiny lights a fire inside you,  

With sparks of bravery and positive energy being emitted from it.  


The fire spreads and strengthens,  

Where feelings, strength, and performance thrive.  


Destiny gives you determination,  

And yourself to turn to.  


Having it is the ability to stand in the face of danger,  

Where fear is nothing but a signal of courage.  


It lets you take responsibilities,  

And carry on with a powerful, beneficial life.   


Destiny is the most important and powerful thing you could ever have,  

So don’t just think, follow your destiny.
