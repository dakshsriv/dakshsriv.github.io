      <description>We’re as stubborn as mules, quick to say we’re the best.
The best follow the rules, the best never do rest.
The best choose wise options, like health and adoption.
Do we? No.
Our priorities are money, and high convenience.
It’s painless as honey. but demands intelligence.
But look at animals: Chimpanzees divide with tortoises.
We must know what to fight for as we fight for what’s right.
Money? Wrong.</description>

      <description>Destiny,
It’s a great responsibility given just to you,
without which you are replaceable.
It is a gift from above,
offered to you along with life.
It gives you a sense of purpose,
Deep inside you.
In the darkest of times,
It lights up your path and glows on what you aspire to master.
It makes your life matter,
and unifies you.
You can become famous,
if you set and follow your destiny.</description>

      <description>A beautiful season with colourful leaves,
Lovely foliage on all the trees,
Not too hot and not too cold,
The autumn colours are very bold.
Red, orange, yellow, and brown,
There’s no reason to wear a frown,
These fall colours are nice and bright,
Everywhere you see it’s a beautiful sight.
As the days begin to shorten,
And the fast winds blow in autumn,
It makes the leaves skitter across the ground,</description>
