      <description>Everybody loves to be in that zone where they are comfortable and laid back. Many feel like they want to stay there forever and never leave. However, it might be a shock to know that zone can ruin your life.
There are 5 main zones in how much you feel comfortable to perform a task: the lost zone, the comfort zone, the discomfort zone, the growth zone, and the danger zone.</description>

      <description>Ever felt like you have no control over your life? Ever felt like your fate is predetermined? Ever felt like every bad thing that happens to you is meant to be, and that they will be unpreventable. You, my friend, need a little bit of locus of control training.
What is a locus of control A locus of control, plural loci of control, is the amount someone thinks they have control over their life.</description>

      <description>One will inevitably encounter several times a week the sensation of empty time; time where it seems nothing productive can be done. Here I&amp;rsquo;m going to tell you how to wisely use that time to your advantage.
First things first, we must sort out the problem. Time where you have tasks left to do but you can&amp;rsquo;t accomplish any of them can be classified as Type 1 Empty Time, and time when you have no tasks left can be classified as Type 2 Empty Time.</description>

      <description>Procrastination is something we all have been affected by. Lounging about for several days and cramming for that test during one night. It usually leads to dismal results. However, there is an easy way to take control of it, rather than have it take cotrol of you.
Procreastination can be broken into two types: Type 1 and Type 2. Type 1 Procrastination is the procrastination we&amp;rsquo;re all familiar with. Here is how it works inside our brains.</description>

      <description>We’re as stubborn as mules, quick to say we’re the best.
The best follow the rules, the best never do rest.
The best choose wise options, like health and adoption.
Do we? No.
Our priorities are money, and high convenience.
It’s painless as honey. but demands intelligence.
But look at animals: Chimpanzees divide with tortoises.
We must know what to fight for as we fight for what’s right.
Money? Wrong.</description>

      <description>Destiny,
It’s a great responsibility given just to you,
without which you are replaceable.
It is a gift from above,
offered to you along with life.
It gives you a sense of purpose,
Deep inside you.
In the darkest of times,
It lights up your path and glows on what you aspire to master.
It makes your life matter,
and unifies you.
You can become famous,
if you set and follow your destiny.</description>

      <description>A beautiful season with colourful leaves,
Lovely foliage on all the trees,
Not too hot and not too cold,
The autumn colours are very bold.
Red, orange, yellow, and brown,
There’s no reason to wear a frown,
These fall colours are nice and bright,
Everywhere you see it’s a beautiful sight.
As the days begin to shorten,
And the fast winds blow in autumn,
It makes the leaves skitter across the ground,</description>
